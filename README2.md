# Let's dive into the development process

The Project is divided into 7 major categories....

1. Project Structure:
The project will be organised in a logical manner. I will be creating separate directories for components, pages, services, utils, etc. This will help keep your codebase clean and maintainable as the project grows.


2. Components:
Based on the requirements, identify the key components you'll need, such as:

Welcome page: This component will be responsible for rendering the welcome page, where the user can select a quiz subject. 

QuizPage: This component will handle the logic and rendering of the quiz, including the QuestionCard component.

QuestionCard: This component will be responsible for rendering a single question and the answer choices.

ThemeToggle: This component will allow the user to switch between light and dark themes.

ScoreBoard: This component will display the user's score at the end of the quiz.


3. State Management: 
We will be using React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks, or integrating a library. This will be important for managing the quiz state, user answers, and theme preferences.
